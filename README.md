# MasterThesis

Here can be found the sound files for the EPFL and B&O master's thesis "Signal Peak Reduction: Towards a Perceptually Motivated Approach". 

The files are rather short time signals so I would recommend opening them in Audacity and play them in loop. Furthermore it is interesting to use Audacity's amplifier to listen to the files at the maximum peak level to hear the difference in loudness and how the sound quality is affected. 

## Comments
Fig6*.wav are the sum of two pure sine waves so they are not nice to hear.
Fig7*.wav is the sum of 50 sines waves of frequency (1,2...50). The files were created for illustrative and not listening pursposes. As most of those components are inaudible, Fig7orange.wav will likely be unheard unless it is amplified to a peak of 1 and the level of the speakers turned on to the maximum. However Fig7blue.wav sounds like a Dirac impluse and can be heard directly.
